/*
Write a function to reverse a string in-place.
Since strings in JavaScript are immutable â†´ , first convert the string into an array of
characters, do the in-place reversal on that array, and re-join that array into a string before
returning it. This isn't technically "in-place" and the array of characters will cost O(n)
additional space, but it's a reasonable way to stay within the spirit of the challenge. If you're
comfortable coding in a language with mutable strings, that'd be even better!
