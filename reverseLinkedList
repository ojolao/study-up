/* Hooray! It's opposite day. Linked lists go the opposite way today.
Write a function for reversing a linked list. ↴ Do it in-place. ↴

Your function will have one input: the head of the list.

Your function should return the new head of the list.

Here's a sample linked list node class:

  function LinkedListNode(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
*/
