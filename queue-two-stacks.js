/* Implement a queue â†´ with 2 stacks. Your queue should have an enqueue and a
dequeue function and it should be "first in first out" (FIFO). Optimize for
the time cost of m function calls on your queue. These can be any mix of
enqueue and dequeue calls.

OR

 * Write a stack using your preferred instantiation pattern.
 * Avoid using native array methods i.e., push, pop, and length.
 * Once you're done, implement a queue using two stacks.
