/* You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.
Each round, players receive a score between 0 and 100, which you use to rank them from
highest to lowest. So far you're using an algorithm that sorts in O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time,
but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast enough. You need a faster
sorting algorithm.

Write a function that takes:

an array of unsortedScores
the highestPossibleScore in the game
and returns a sorted array of scores in less than O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time.
